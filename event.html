			Educational trips enrich the students' learning by taking them to important locations related to their lessons in subjects such as art, history, science, and biology. Educational trips allow students to experience learning in exciting new environments outside their day-to-day school activities.

			High School Night is a coming-of-age event with two goals: first, help students prepare for young adulthood by bringing all of them together to practice the good social graces and etiquette in a formal setting. Second, here is when grade ten students formally pass their responsibility as leaders of junior high to the next generation of grade ten leaders.

			We commemorate the foundation of our school every end of January. We celebrate by having fun activities such as a talent show, field demos,  fundraising games by the parent councils, and a school bazaar operated and organized by the student council. Parents and relatives are all invited to join their children in this opportunity for bonding and togetherness.
